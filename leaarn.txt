Using API
we get this from the API sites: a json response
    To get these we us 'axios'

    axios.get('......')     the get request which is async in nature
    .then(res => {
        //get the response from the Api in console
        console.log(res)
        // put it in some state variable
    })


Lifecycle methods :
 constructor loads before everyone 
 then the render method
 and after the render there is componentDidMount


NewsApi only lets you use the data on localhost
